# Recipe sub-flow

The orchestrator-owned spec for executing any recipe in `references/recipes/`. Recipes never re-implement this — they fill in the named sections referenced from the diagram nodes (see `references/recipes/_template/RECIPE.md` for the authoring guide).

Retry budget = **1** additional Apply (≤ 2 Applies total). Each diagram node names the recipe section it consults using markdown header refs (`# Applicable`, `# Scope`, etc. — these map to top-level headings in the recipe file).

## Result emission

Each recipe completes by emitting **exactly one** result block. The orchestrator parses the `RESULT:` line; the rest is human-readable context.

```
RESULT: <Success|Blocker|Rejected|Failure>
SOURCE: $SOURCE
RECIPE: axon4to5-<component>
FILES_CHANGED: [<path>, ...]
NOTES: <one short paragraph — why this result, what to look at next>
```

## Invariants

- **Applicable check sits outside Research** — cheap surface check on `$SOURCE` alone; don't pay the Research cost for the wrong recipe.
- **Scope before References** (inside Research) — `scope` drives *which* `references` sections are read.
- **Research is a fixed-point loop** — exits only when SQ says "no new in-scope items"; `scope` can only grow.
- **Single Check Success Criteria** — same evaluation logic pre- and post-Apply; the diamond branches on whether retry budget remains.
- **Blocker fires only from `Blocker in scope?`** — emitted after Research stabilizes. Check / Plan / Apply never short-circuit to Blocker; partial work either passes the Check or counts as Failure.
- **Apply loop is `Check → Plan → Apply → Check`** — only Apply consumes the retry budget. Adjust activities (re-research, source consultation) are *free*.
- **Adjust is open-ended** — on retry the AI picks any subset of: extend scope, consult Axon 5 sources / context7, rethink the approach. Plan Migration is rebuilt each iteration using whatever new info Adjust gathered.
- **Recipe owns content; orchestrator owns control flow.** A recipe never decides "retry" or "skip a step" — it only fills the named sections referenced from the diagram nodes.
